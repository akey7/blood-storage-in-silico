# blood-storage-in-silico
Code (but not data) to analyze in silico models of blood storage.

## Prepare to process data

1. In the root of this repo, create the `input/` and `output/` folders. The contents of these folders will not be committed to this repo. That is intentional--in this project, the repo should only be used to store source code.

2. Place [this `.csv` file from Nemkov et al](https://www.frontiersin.org/api/v4/articles/833242/file/Data_Sheet_1.CSV/833242_supplementary-materials_datasheets_1_csv/1) into the `input` folder.
